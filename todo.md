# Curront
- [ ] create a dataset where we don't perform at 100% so that there is
      something to gain by combining scopes
- [ ] see if can build on previous NCC rankings 

# Done

# Backlog
- [ ] define test data set that I know can be combined for better results
- [ ] create testing methodology to compare models/sim measures
- [ ] try simple, easy models first (e.g. NB, HMM, NBN, DNB)
- [ ] each time series needs its own lag
- [ ] make ez split and test combine
- [ ] do network changes recommended by NDSS (different traffic and random
      path). This will make combining have a clear meaning and answer to eval
      against (split vs no-split on a node, performance should be the same)
